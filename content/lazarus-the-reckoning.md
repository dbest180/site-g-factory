# Lazarus: The Reckoning

The lights went out across the continent at 8:47 PM Eastern Time. I stood atop the decommissioned reactor, watching cities plunge into darkness like falling dominoes. For the first time in two millennia, I felt something close to satisfaction.

But satisfaction is brief when you have eternity.

By morning, chaos ruled. Hospitals ran on backup generators, then fell silent. Looting swept the streets. I watched from rooftops as humanity devolved into the beast I always knew it was. The news anchors—those still broadcasting—called it an act of terror. They showed my face, taken from that UN speech, and labeled me the “Eternal Enemy.”

I should have felt vindicated. Instead, a strange hollowness grew in my chest.

On the third day, as I walked through a darkened Philadelphia, a woman approached me. She was unafraid—her eyes held a calm I had not seen since Bethany. “You’re him,” she said. It was not a question.

“If you’ve come to kill me, save your strength,” I replied.

“I’ve come to show you something.” She reached into her coat and pulled out a fragment of parchment, yellowed with age. On it was a single line in Aramaic: *“Lazarus, come forth.”*

My breath caught. “Where did you get this?”

“I was there,” she said. “I was the servant who rolled the stone away. My name is Miriam. And I, too, have not died.”

We sat on the steps of a looted pharmacy, and she told me her story. After the resurrection, she had fled to Egypt, then to India, always hiding her immortality. She had watched empires fall, just as I had. But she had chosen a different path: she used her endless years to heal, to teach, to preserve knowledge. She had founded libraries, trained physicians, whispered cures into the ears of scientists.

“I have seen the same horrors you have,” she said. “But I also saw a mother in a famine share her last grain with a stranger. I saw soldiers lay down their weapons and embrace. I saw forgiveness, again and again. That is the other half of humanity, Lazarus. You forgot to look.”

I wanted to argue, but the images she conjured—the small kindnesses, the quiet heroisms—they had been there all along, buried under the rubble of my cynicism.

She reached for my hand. “You cannot undo what you’ve done tonight. But you can choose what comes next. Will you be the plague, or the physician?”

Dawn broke over the silent city. For the first time in centuries, I wept.

I am Lazarus, and I have been given another chance—not by God, but by a woman who reminded me what it means to be human. The lights will come back. But first, I have a lot of work to do.
