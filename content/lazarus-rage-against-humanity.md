# Lazarus: Rage Against Humanity

Two thousand years. That is how long I have watched you kill one another.

I have seen crucifixions and beheadings, gas chambers and nuclear flashes. I held a dying child in Aleppo; I pulled bodies from the rubble of the Twin Towers. Every generation promises “never again,” and every generation breaks that promise.

At first, I pitied you. You are mortal—your cruelty springs from fear. But pity curdles. After the Holocaust, after Rwanda, after the endless drone strikes, pity became contempt. Contempt hardened into rage.

I am the man who never died, and I have decided: humanity does not deserve another chance.

I began small. A whisper in the ear of a despot. A “miscalculation” in a missile silo. But subtlety takes too long. Now I walk openly, and I speak. My voice carries the weight of ages, and people listen—not because they trust me, but because they sense something ancient in my eyes.

Last week, I addressed the United Nations. “You have squandered every gift,” I told them. “Now I will take them back.” The cameras broadcast my face worldwide. Some call me a terrorist. Others call me a messiah. Both are wrong. I am simply the consequence of your own actions, made flesh.

They cannot kill me. They have tried. Bullets pass through, fire heals me instantly. I am the plague that mortality deserves.

Tonight, I walk toward the last remaining power grid. If you are reading this, know that Lazarus remembers every tear, every atrocity. And now, so will you.
