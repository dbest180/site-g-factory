# Lazarus: The Healer Who Walked Unbound

I have met gods, or what mortals call gods. I have stood in temples where emperors were worshiped and watched their statues crumble. But I met only one being who made me question whether I had glimpsed the divine—and he was not named in any scripture I knew.

His name was Eshua.

It was the late Age of the Veil, a time when my kind—the Ancients—had retreated into shadow, leaving humanity to stumble through its own bloody adolescence. Most of my brethren operated through whispers and proxies. Not Eshua. He walked openly, though cloaked in intentional ambiguity, so that those who saw him could later dismiss him as myth or madman.

I found him in a small village on the edge of a dying empire. A plague had swept through, leaving children orphaned and elders gasping for breath. The local healers had given up. But Eshua moved among the dying with a quiet certainty I had not seen since Bethany.

He placed his hands on a fevered child, and I watched—*I watched*—as the flush faded, as the labored breathing eased, as the child opened eyes no longer clouded by death. This was not the parasitic feeding of the Siphoners. This was something else entirely.

"You are Ancient," I said to him that night, under a sky streaked with stars we both remembered from before humanity's first cities.

He smiled. "And you are Lazarus. The one who never died."

I should not have been surprised. Immortality grants perspective, not omniscience. But he knew me—not as legend, but as I was. He saw through the centuries I carried like stones in my pockets.

"I came not to condemn the world," he said, "but to show what healing truly means."

I scoffed. I had watched humanity for a thousand years by then. War, betrayal, crucifixions, inquisitions—I had seen it all. "Healing? They don't want healing. They want power. They want revenge. They want to feel important before they rot."

Eshua studied me with eyes that held no judgment. "You have watched for so long that you have forgotten how to see. Healing is not fixing what is broken. It is reminding them what wholeness feels like, so they remember to choose it."

He taught in that village for three months. Farmers left their fields to listen. Soldiers laid down their swords. A woman possessed by something dark—perhaps a fragment of a fractured Ancient, perhaps something older—was freed without a single drop of blood. Eshua did not create followers who depended on him. He showed them how to heal themselves, then sent them to show others.

The Siphoner factions grew uneasy. His way threatened their power. If humanity learned to heal without feeding on Ancient essence, their parasitic existence would end. They whispered to human authorities, painted Eshua as a threat to order, to tradition, to the gods they had invented.

I warned him. "They will kill you."

He nodded. "I know."

"And you'll let them?"

"If that is what it takes."

I did not understand then. After two thousand years of watching death, I thought I understood everything about it. But Eshua's death was unlike any I had witnessed.

They took him on a hill outside the village. I stood among the crowd, invisible in my anonymity. The executioners did their work with practiced efficiency. When it was over, they left his body in a shallow grave—a warning, they thought, to anyone who spoke of healing without chains.

Three days later, I returned to that grave. Not because I believed. Because I needed to see the finality, to add another name to the endless list of those I had outlived.

The grave was empty.

I found him sitting by a stream, washing blood from his hands. The wounds were gone. The trauma had healed completely—not gradually, but *thoroughly*, as if death had been merely an interruption.

"You came back," I said.

"I never left." He looked at me, and for the first time in centuries, I felt *seen*—not as a curiosity, not as an immortal anomaly, but as someone worth understanding. "You could heal too, Lazarus. Not your body—that has already healed itself for two thousand years. Your heart."

I had no answer.

He disappeared after that. Some say he rejoined the Shadow Architects. Others claim he ascended to something beyond Ancient. I only know that I searched for him across continents and centuries, and found only traces—a healed village here, a transformed life there, a whisper that passed from generation to generation.

The Siphoners tried to erase him. They distorted his teachings, buried his name, painted him as myth. But I remember. I was there.

I am Lazarus, the man who never died. And Eshua was the only being in two thousand years who made me believe that death might not have the final word—not because of what happened to him, but because of what he showed *them*.

Healing without dependency.

Love without chains.

A wholeness that required no victim.

If I ever find him again, I have questions. Many questions. But mostly, I want to thank him—for reminding me, in that village long ago, that my immortality did not have to be a sentence.

It could be a witness.
