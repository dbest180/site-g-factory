        <h1>Lazarus: The Man Who Never Died</h1>
<p>The tomb smelled of linen and myrrh. For four days, I had known nothing—no dreams, no darkness, only an absence so complete it felt like a forgotten word. Then came the voice.</p>
<p><em>“Lazarus, come forth.”</em></p>
<p>It was not a command but an invitation. Light flooded the cave, and I stumbled out, still wrapped in grave clothes. My sisters Mary and Martha wept with joy. The man who had called me—Jesus—smiled, but in his eyes I saw a flicker of something else. Perhaps sorrow. Perhaps knowledge of what my second life would become.</p>
<p>At first, everything was as before. I ate, I laughed, I returned to our small house in Bethany. But soon I noticed changes. A cut on my hand healed in hours. I no longer tired. When a Roman soldier struck me during a dispute, the bruise faded before sunset. I began to understand: death had lost its hold on me entirely.</p>
<p>Years passed. Jesus was crucified and rose again—but he ascended. I remained. Friends aged and died; their children called me “the eternal one.” I watched Jerusalem fall to Titus, saw the Temple burn, and felt no flame. Empires rose and crumbled, and I walked through every funeral, every plague, every war, untouched.</p>
<p>I am Lazarus, the man who never died. And I have learned that immortality is not a gift—it is a sentence.</p>
