<h1>Lazarus: The Reckoning</h1>
<p>The lights went out across the continent at 8:47 PM Eastern Time. I stood atop the decommissioned reactor, watching cities plunge into darkness like falling dominoes. For the first time in two millennia, I felt something close to satisfaction.</p>
<p>But satisfaction is brief when you have eternity.</p>
<p>By morning, chaos ruled. Hospitals ran on backup generators, then fell silent. Looting swept the streets. I watched from rooftops as humanity devolved into the beast I always knew it was. The news anchors—those still broadcasting—called it an act of terror. They showed my face, taken from that UN speech, and labeled me the “Eternal Enemy.”</p>
<p>I should have felt vindicated. Instead, a strange hollowness grew in my chest.</p>
<p>On the third day, as I walked through a darkened Philadelphia, a woman approached me. She was unafraid—her eyes held a calm I had not seen since Bethany. “You’re him,” she said. It was not a question.</p>
<p>“If you’ve come to kill me, save your strength,” I replied.</p>
<p>“I’ve come to show you something.” She reached into her coat and pulled out a fragment of parchment, yellowed with age. On it was a single line in Aramaic: <em>“Lazarus, come forth.”</em></p>
<p>My breath caught. “Where did you get this?”</p>
<p>“I was there,” she said. “I was the servant who rolled the stone away. My name is Miriam. And I, too, have not died.”</p>
<p>We sat on the steps of a looted pharmacy, and she told me her story. After the resurrection, she had fled to Egypt, then to India, always hiding her immortality. She had watched empires fall, just as I had. But she had chosen a different path: she used her endless years to heal, to teach, to preserve knowledge. She had founded libraries, trained physicians, whispered cures into the ears of scientists.</p>
<p>“I have seen the same horrors you have,” she said. “But I also saw a mother in a famine share her last grain with a stranger. I saw soldiers lay down their weapons and embrace. I saw forgiveness, again and again. That is the other half of humanity, Lazarus. You forgot to look.”</p>
<p>I wanted to argue, but the images she conjured—the small kindnesses, the quiet heroisms—they had been there all along, buried under the rubble of my cynicism.</p>
<p>She reached for my hand. “You cannot undo what you’ve done tonight. But you can choose what comes next. Will you be the plague, or the physician?”</p>
<p>Dawn broke over the silent city. For the first time in centuries, I wept.</p>
<p>I am Lazarus, and I have been given another chance—not by God, but by a woman who reminded me what it means to be human. The lights will come back. But first, I have a lot of work to do.</p>
