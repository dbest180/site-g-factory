        <h1>Lazarus: Through the Ages</h1>
<p>I have worn many names. In Rome, they called me Lucius the Eternal. In Constantinople, I was the Monk Who Would Not Sleep. In the trenches of the Somme, I was simply “that strange soldier” who crawled out of shell holes without a scratch.</p>
<p>After Bethany, I wandered. The first century was a blur of grief—I outlived my sisters, my friends, even John, the beloved disciple who had written down the story of my raising. He looked at me on his deathbed in Ephesus and whispered, “You are the sign he left behind.” Then he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>I tried to die. I threw myself from cliffs, drank poison, sought martyrdom in the Colosseum. Each time, my body knitted itself back together. Eventually I stopped trying.</p>
<p>So I watched. I saw Attila turn back from Rome; I stood in the crowd at Hagia Sophia’s consecration; I sharpened quills for monks copying Scripture. I met Leonardo, who sketched me and muttered about “eternal proportions.” I drank coffee with Voltaire, who called my story “an amusing fable.”</p>
<p>Through it all, I kept silent about my identity. But I kept a journal—parchment, then paper, now digital files—recording every era, every lesson. I became a scholar of humanity, because I had nothing but time.</p>
<p>Now, in the twenty‑first century, I live in a small apartment, writing under a pseudonym. My neighbors think I’m a reclusive historian. They don’t know that I actually <em>was</em> there.</p>
